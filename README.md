# Update Sets for Clone Data Preservers in ServiceNow

## Getting Started
This repo currently contains one update set, which will work on both v5 and v6 of the Pagerduty app.

## Important to Note:
These update sets will not install the Pagerduty application, rather, they're used to preserve your PagerDuty data when cloning your Servicenow instance from one environment to another. For further context, hints, and instructions, please visit our Support article on the subject [here](https://support.pagerduty.com/v1/docs/servicenow-using-the-clone-data-preserver). 

## Prerequisites
You will need to be an admin or clone_admin user in ServiceNow to utilize these. 

## Uploading and Committing your Update Set
- Navigate to Update Sets to Commit
- Select import from XML
- Import your Update Set and Upload
- Click into the Update Set and Preview
- Once the Preview is finished, Commit the Update Set
